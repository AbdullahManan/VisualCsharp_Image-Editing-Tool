# VisualCsharp_Image-Editing-Tool
# 2nd Semester Final Project
This project was my final project for the 2nd semester. I built an image viewer application using Windows Forms in C#. This project was assigned to us individually so making it was a bit of a challenge, but working on it helped me understand how Windows Forms applications work, how different components function, and how to effectively use the toolbox and design tools in Visual Studio. Through this, I learned how to implement features like image loading, zoom, saving with background, and handling user interactions. Though it was a bit challenging, but I really had fun making this project. It really strengthened my understanding of building desktop applications with C# and gave me hands-on experience with the Windows Forms environment.
